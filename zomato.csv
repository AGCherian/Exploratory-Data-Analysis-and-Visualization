" this place offers good ambiance. The staff here are friendly. The menu looks a bit different than other places... quirky and mashed up with some international cuisines or so they claim. However the food tasted pretty average. The pasta vegetarian dishes were nicely done. However the chicken breast with a cooked banana was a bit over done. The competition for Italian cuisine is at a different level in Bangalore. So I would probably have them work on their pastas a bit more to really be upto that mark. The dessert (thiramisu) wasn't great either but full marks on the presentation. A very quiet and nice place overall."""")",1

 with less seating.\nAfternoon hunger cannot control by anyone,1
 with the iconic dal makhni and ever mouthwatering panner butter masala. Nans were soft and great in taste. Dal makhni is by far the best I have had ever. Panner gravy was dissapoting as it was bit sour in taste.\n\nService was lighting fast.\n\nAgain one more restaurant in town who charges service charge.\n\nThis is place is worth trying but I give one ? less because of the parking,1

enjoying the crowd.The service was great despite of the fact 8t was packed.Lets talk about the food now,1
everything is equally good\n\nmusic is amazingly well selected and chosen\n\nvery reasonable pricing \n\nWish you good luck for keep doing better and better'),1
juicy and fatty..just like it should be.\nAbout the ambience: The ambience was good,1
paneer satay. Below average stuff. Thai papays salad was better but still very ordinary both in taste & looks. Drinks were the worst of the lot. Tea had no flavours at all. The less I speak abt the cooler the better. Pricing is also not really reasonable but then they have Zomato Gold. A very below par experience.'),1
pepper chicken was great. At the end we ordered jeera rice with Dal Tadka and that was truly the best.'),1
